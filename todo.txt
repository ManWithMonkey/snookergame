Important:
- keyboard input
- cue aiming, pull strength and release
- holes
- way to identify balls from one another (number, character?)
- turns
- scorekeeping
- gameplay
- more reliable collision system

Visual:
- use predefined strings and sizes to draw circles for clear and less chaotic look, like:

    /---\
    | 8 |
    \---/

- cursor blinks at bottom left corner, could be invisible
- color?

Maybe:
- ncurses
- multiplayer
